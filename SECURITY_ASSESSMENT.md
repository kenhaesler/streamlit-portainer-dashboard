# Vulnerability Assessment

## Scope
This assessment evaluates whether the Streamlit Portainer Dashboard is exposed to the following CVEs reported by Trivy:

- CVE-2023-45853
- CVE-2025-7458

## Findings
### CVE-2023-45853 – MiniZip integer overflow
- **Upstream issue**: The vulnerability affects the optional MiniZip component distributed alongside zlib through version 1.3, and projects that embed the vulnerable MiniZip sources such as `pyminizip`. Exploitation requires invoking `zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64` with attacker-controlled metadata.【e2462a†L1-L20】
- **Application usage**: The dashboard's Python dependencies are limited to Streamlit, requests, pandas, plotly, PyYAML, python-dotenv, and a small Streamlit helper. None of these packages bundle or expose MiniZip or `pyminizip`, and the application code does not directly interface with zlib's MiniZip APIs.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L7】
- **Result**: Not affected. The deployment does not include or call the vulnerable MiniZip code paths, so the CVE is not exploitable in this project.

### CVE-2025-7458 – SQLite `KeyInfo` integer overflow
- **Upstream issue**: The flaw exists in SQLite versions 3.39.2 through 3.41.1 when executing crafted `SELECT` statements containing large `ORDER BY` expression lists.【4393e4†L1-L9】 Exploitation requires an attacker to run arbitrary SQL against an affected SQLite engine.
- **Application usage**: The dashboard relies on Streamlit and associated Python libraries and does not bundle or invoke SQLite. A repository-wide search shows no usage of SQLite APIs or SQL database integrations.【d62857†L1-L2】
- **Result**: Not affected. Because the application neither ships SQLite nor executes SQL queries, the vulnerability cannot be triggered in this environment.

## February 2025 – Additional CVE review
Trivy recently reported a broader set of Debian 12 package advisories against the container image. The following review maps each
finding to the components that are actually present in the Streamlit Portainer Dashboard build.

| Component | CVEs | Assessment | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `libpython3.11-minimal`, `libpython3.11-stdlib`, `python3.11-minimal` | CVE-2025-8194, CVE-2025-4516, CVE-2025-6069 | Not applicable | The container is built from Python 3.12 base images and never installs Python 3.11 runtimes or standard libraries.【F:Dockerfile†L1-L24】 |
| `pip` 25.2 | CVE-2025-8869 | Removed from runtime image | The build stage now deletes the `pip` binaries and modules after installing the Python dependencies, so the final distroless layer does not include the vulnerable tooling.【F:Dockerfile†L5-L10】 |
| `libsqlite3-0` | CVE-2025-29088, CVE-2025-7709, CVE-2021-45346 | Not exploitable | Neither the application code nor its declared dependencies use SQLite APIs, so an attacker has no path to trigger SQLite query execution.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L7】【039b84†L1-L1】 |
| `libexpat1` | CVE-2025-59375, CVE-2023-52426, CVE-2024-28757 | Low risk in current workload | The dashboard does not parse XML documents, so the Expat parser is dormant. Continue to monitor upstream distroless releases for patched builds.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L7】【ea0168†L1-L1】 |
| `libncursesw6`, `libtinfo6` | CVE-2023-50495, CVE-2025-6141 | Not used | The dashboard is a Streamlit web UI and does not load the curses bindings that depend on these terminal libraries.【F:requirements.txt†L1-L7】 |
| `libuuid1`, `libgcc-s1`, `libstdc++6`, `libgomp1`, `libssl3`, `libc6`, Kerberos libraries | Multiple low-severity Debian advisories | Covered by upstream | These shared libraries are inherited from `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:nonroot`. No project code calls their vulnerable entry points, but you should continue to consume the latest distroless images so that upstream security fixes land automatically.【F:Dockerfile†L15-L24】 |

None of the newly reported CVEs expand the attack surface of the current application configuration. Continue to rebuild the
container image regularly so that distroless and Debian security updates are incorporated.

### Runtime footprint adjustments
- Stripped the `pip` CLI and module tree from the final image so that only the runtime dependencies remain under `/usr/local`.
  This prevents package-manager CVEs from surfacing in vulnerability scans while keeping the application dependencies intact.【F:Dockerfile†L5-L10】

## Conclusion
Neither the newly reviewed CVEs nor the previously analysed CVE-2023-45853 and CVE-2025-7458 impact the Streamlit Portainer
Dashboard as presently configured. No remediation is required for this codebase today. Continue to monitor base images for
unrelated security updates as part of routine maintenance.
